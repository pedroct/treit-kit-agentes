# Feature Implementation

## Steps
1. Locate entry points and owners.
2. Implement the smallest viable change.
3. Update or add tests.
4. Verify using existing tooling when possible.
5. Document what was verified.

## Stack notes
- Keep frontend in React/Next.js patterns.
- Prefer service boundaries for Node, FastAPI, and Spring.
- Consider integration and pipeline impact.
