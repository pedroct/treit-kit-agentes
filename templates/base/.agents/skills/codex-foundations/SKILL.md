# Codex Foundations

## When to use
Use for any task in this repo or when behavior is unclear.

## Principles
- Prefer concrete, reproducible steps.
- Be explicit about assumptions and constraints.
- Keep changes small and reviewable.
- Report when tests were not run.

## Stack awareness
- Frontend: React/Next.js
- Backend: Node.js, Python/FastAPI, Java/Spring
- Integrations, pipelines, and CI/CD are first-class concerns.

## Execution
1. Inspect the repository structure before editing.
2. Use `rg` for search.
3. Use `apply_patch` for small edits and scripts for bulk changes.
4. Provide file references for modified files.

## Output format
- Short summary of changes.
- Follow-up actions if needed.
